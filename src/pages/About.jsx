          Hi, I’m <strong>Mohamed Asif</strong> — a tech enthusiast and problem-solver currently working as a consultant, where I support the financial side of technology operations. I enjoy exploring how technology can improve real-world experiences, and I actively work on personal projects ranging from websites to AI-driven assistants.

        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)" }}>
          I have a background in IT, hands-on experience with web development, and I’m currently helping my firm as it transitions to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. I love learning new tools, building clean user experiences, and turning ideas into working products — whether it’s a life-lesson sharing platform, a smart shopping chatbot, or a unique emotional currency system.I believe in continuous improvement, creating things that genuinely help people, and staying curious every day.
        </p>
